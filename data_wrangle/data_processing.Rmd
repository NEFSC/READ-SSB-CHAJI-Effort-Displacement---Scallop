We will:

1. Try to avoid copying data; when we rely on data from other people, we will read it directly into memory from the network location or Oracle.
1. Sometimes this is unnecessary, so we will copy external data into the "data/external" folder. We will have a separate subfolder for shapefiles.
1. Store an intermediate data product in "data/intermediate".
1. Store final data products in "data/main."
1. Use a vintage "suffix" to denote when we have extracted data.

# Introduction

The main idea of the model is that the fishermen/decision-makers choose from a number of alternatives, where the choice occasion is a fishing trip and selects the one that yields the highest expected utility level on any given choice occasion. By observing and modeling how decision-makers change their preferred site option in response to the changes in the levels of the site attributes, it is possible to determine how decision-makers tradeoff between the different fishing ground characteristics.

# Long Term Objectives
The project objective is to develop a site-choice model primarily, improve, maintain, and disseminate a standardized fisheries dependent data set and analytical summaries that provide a more precise, accurate, comprehensive, and timely evaluation of area-specific socioeconomic impacts associated with ecosystem fishery management initiatives, offshore energy development, and offshore aquaculture development. The site-choice model and underlying data set will help support fishery and ecosystem management decisions to achieve optimum yield in each fishery and the nationâ€™s most significant benefit.

Understanding the effects of wind energy areas that are early in the process may be more impactful from a policy perspective. So, not necessarily the current wind areas, but the next block that may be coming over the next 10-30 years.  Also, cumulative effects may be important.


# Empirical Setting

## Scallop Fishery

We are modeling the location choices of fishing vessels in the Limited Access Days-at-Sea scallop fishery. There are approximately 300-330 of these fishing vessels.  They are allocated "Open Area Days-at-Sea" and a quantity of trips and/or pounds into the "Access Areas."  They catch approximately 95% of the scallops.  The Limited Access DAS fleet can be further subdivided into Full-Time, Part-Time, and Occasional Fleets.  Vessels primarily use the New Bedford scallop dredge, but a few use a smaller dredge or a bottom trawl.  Over the 13 years in our dataset, there are approximately 40,000 trips taken by this fleet, split roughly evenly into "Open areas" and "Access Areas."

For Fishing Year 2016 and earlier, the fishing year Ran from March 1 to Feb 28/29. For fishing year 2017, the year ran from March 1 to March 31.  For 2018 and later, the fishing year runs from April 1 to March 31.

## Wind Energy

Here is a short description of the wind energy areas and how they will close (or not close) area to fishing.  18 wind areas currently under dev.  But many more are likely.

How close will fishing be able to occur within Wind Lease Areas / Turbines?  

The wind energy areas do not match the ten minute squares; we are currently planning on simulating the effects of closing a wind energy area by closing an entire ten minute square that is inside or touching a WEA.  

The buried cable route from a WEA to shore is likely to be closed as well.  Cable buried at shallow depths and marked with concrete.


We  classify the vessels as FullTime, PartTime based on these PLAN_CAT variables that are in DMIS. We also generate categorical variables corresponding to LA and GC columns. Note that a vessel can hold both an LA and a GC permit at the same time. The summary tables below will have lots of observations corresponding to Scallop_Linkingorg[ftpt]=0, LA=0, and GC=0. This is expected, because it has everything from DMIS. 

It's not entirely clear how the the PLAN_CAT variables are constructed in DMIS.  They are derived from permit data, which is generated when the vessel owner renews a permit at the beginning of the fishing year, when an owner transfers a permit, or when a permit is added. The freqency of the underlyingy data is irregular, but approximately annual.  The DMIS algorithm may match to the permit holdings on the day of the trip, or it may match to the permit held at the beginning of the year. When there is a conflict between these variables (PLAN_CAT, ftpt, GC, LA) and the variables based on ACTIVITY_CODE (Plan Code and Program Code), we should prefer the variables based on ACTIVITY_CODE.


```{r DMIS_Tidy, echo=TRUE}
# Bin the LA vessels into full time or part time. 
Scallop_Linkingorg$ftpt<-"None"
Scallop_Linkingorg$ftpt[Scallop_Linkingorg$SC_2=="TRUE"]<-"FullTime"
Scallop_Linkingorg$ftpt[Scallop_Linkingorg$SC_5=="TRUE"]<-"FullTime"
Scallop_Linkingorg$ftpt[Scallop_Linkingorg$SC_7=="TRUE"]<-"FullTime"

Scallop_Linkingorg$ftpt[Scallop_Linkingorg$SC_3=="TRUE"]<-"PartTime"
Scallop_Linkingorg$ftpt[Scallop_Linkingorg$SC_6=="TRUE"]<-"PartTime"
Scallop_Linkingorg$ftpt[Scallop_Linkingorg$SC_8=="TRUE"]<-"PartTime"

Scallop_Linkingorg$ftpt[Scallop_Linkingorg$SC_4=="TRUE"]<-"Occasional"
Scallop_Linkingorg$ftpt[Scallop_Linkingorg$SC_9=="TRUE"]<-"Occasional"


# Construct a logical variable for GC
Scallop_Linkingorg$GC<-(Scallop_Linkingorg$LGC_A=="TRUE" | Scallop_Linkingorg$LGC_B=="TRUE" | Scallop_Linkingorg$LGC_C=="TRUE" | Scallop_Linkingorg$SG_1A=="TRUE" | Scallop_Linkingorg$SG_1B=="TRUE") 

# Construct a logical variable for LA
Scallop_Linkingorg$LA<-(Scallop_Linkingorg$ftpt=="PartTime" | Scallop_Linkingorg$ftpt=="FullTime")


#Make some tables
table(Scallop_Linkingorg$ftpt)

table(Scallop_Linkingorg$GC)

table(Scallop_Linkingorg$LA,Scallop_Linkingorg$GC)

#Select certain columns
Scallop_Linkingorg_bak<-Scallop_Linkingorg
Scallop_Linkingorg<-dplyr::select(Scallop_Linkingorg, c(TRIP_ID,DOCID, ACTIVITY_CODE, ftpt, GC,LA))

is.logical(Scallop_Linkingorg$GC)
is.logical(Scallop_Linkingorg$LA)
```


We don't want to create a single plan column, because a vessel could have multiple kinds of scallop permits. Instead, if we want just the Fulltime LA vessels, we can do something like:


```{r DMIS_FT_filter, eval=FALSE}

Limited_Access <-Scallop_Linkingorg %>%
    filter(LA=="TRUE")
Limited_Access_ft<-Limited_Access %>%
    filter(ftpt=="FullTime")


```

# Merging

1. Merge Scallops & VTR Data Sets (RESULT.COMPILED). We keep all columns from both the APSD_DMIS_2 and RESULT.COMPILED datasets. We also:
     1. Filter out 2020 values 
     1. Delete Extra PERMIT Column because there were a few missing values.
     1. Delete all TRIPCATG that are not 1. This isolates all commercial trips
     1. Drop rows corresponding to a "Not Fished" VTR. 
2. Join the output of (1) with Activity Codes 
3. Verify that we get what we think we should get.

# Converting Revenues to Real Dollars 

In order to construct operating profits later on we need to ensure that DOLLAR and TRIP_COST_WINSOR_2020_DOL match. The original data set has DOLLAR in nominal dollars and TRIP_COST_WINSOR_2020_DOL is in 2020 Real Dollars. To make the conversion we will use GDP Implicit Price Deflators collected from the Federal Reserve Bank and adjust the index to Q2 2020 to match calculation methods of the TRIP_COST_WINSOR_2020_DOL variable. 

```{r obtain and set fred API key, echo=TRUE}

# Instructions for using the fredr package, a R client for the 'FRED' API, to import Federal Reserve deflator data; obtain a unique API key and set up your unique API key for multiple uses.   

## In order to obtain your API key you must create an account and submit a description of this application using the [Federal Reserve's website](https://research.stlouisfed.org/useraccount/apikey). Additional resources on API keys can be found [here](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/api_key.html). After obtaining your API key you will need to open the .Renviron file located in your network drive. Once you have your .Renviron file open, you will then need to save your API using the following format: FRED_API_KEY=abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz123456

## Alternatively, you can set a once per session key by using the following command

# Data Aggregating Trip Revenues & Delete duplicate TRIPIDs

Subtrips are generated when a vessel switches gear or statistical areas. Subtrips have identical TRIPID/DOCID.  A trip may have many (8+) subtrips, but the majority of trips observed only have one subtrip (95.7% using original VTR & DMIS merged data set). If a trip has just 1 subtrip, the trip took place in a single statistical area.  If a trip crosses four different statistical areas, the NSUBTRIP is then equal to 4, and the landings, value, latitude, and longitude are reported separately for each area. 


```{r count_subtrips, echo=TRUE}
table(VTR_DMIS_AC$NSUBTRIP)
```



Since our goal is to estimate a choice model at the trip level, we need to construct trip level variables.  
 We retained the subtrip attributes  (GEARCODE, DDLAT, DDLON) corresponding to the subtrip with the highest DOLLAR.  We constructed trip-level values for revenue, pounds, and landed (DOLLAR, POUNDS, LANDED).  The trip level variables are prefixed with "Agg_". 

1. Aggregate DOLLAR, POUNDS, LANDED
1. Add back into original data set 
1. Check / Test Maximum DOLLAR values by grouping by TRIPID
1. Drop duplicate TRIPIDs by keeping maximum DOLLAR values 

This may not be realistic. There are anecdotes of vessels fishing in one spot on the way to another, further offshore spot.  Subtrips may be a bigger issue when we extend to other fisheries.If we have the ability to model fishing choices at a finer scale than at a trip, this can be modified fairly easily.


## DEPRECATED - Code to aggregate subtrip landings to subtrips.

We are now pulling subtrips along to the end instead of aggregating.  If you want to contract multi-area or multi-gear trips down to a single observation, this is how you would do it.

```{r construct_trip_aggregates, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
### 1. Aggregate DOLLAR, POUNDS, LANDED
Agg_DOL_POUN_LAND <- VTR_DMIS_AC %>%
  group_by(TRIPID) %>%
 summarise(Agg_DOLLAR = sum(DOLLAR), Agg_POUNDS = sum(POUNDS), Agg_LANDED = sum(LANDED))

#### Testing to make sure there are no duplicates in TRIPID groups; this should equal 0
sum(duplicated(Agg_DOL_POUN_LAND$TRIPID))
stopifnot(sum(duplicated(Agg_DOL_POUN_LAND$TRIPID))==0)

###  2. Add back into original data set 
#### all = FALSE is used to keep only rows that match from the data frames
VTR_DMIS_AC_Agg <- merge(VTR_DMIS_AC,Agg_DOL_POUN_LAND, by.x = "TRIPID", by.y = "TRIPID", all.x = TRUE, all.y = FALSE)


### 3.Parse out Maximum Scallop Dollar amounts in order to drop lesser subtrips
VTR_DMIS_AC_Agg <- VTR_DMIS_AC_Agg %>% 
  group_by(TRIPID) %>%
  filter(DOLLAR == max(DOLLAR))


### Another way to check this is by running the following code: VTR_DMIS_AC_Agg %>% group_by(TRIPID) %>% arrange(desc(DOLLAR)) %>% slice(1)

## Test out 
sum(duplicated(VTR_DMIS_AC_Agg$TRIPID))

stopifnot(sum(duplicated(VTR_DMIS_AC_Agg$TRIPID))==0)


```

# Zone and Lease Assignments 

Using the FishSET spatial join method the chunk below will create two new variables, ZoneID and lease_FS. ZoneID will reflect what zone an observation will be binned into after the spatial join. lease_FS contains the name of the wind lease area an observation takes place in using the same join method. Note if an observation is not within a wind lease area the lease_FS value will be NA.

# Here is some code that we are no longer using. 

## Code to filter on the Limited Access (LA) Fleet using landings and crew size
We considered filtering out the LADAS scallop fleet by using landings greater than or equal to 850 pounds and Crew less than or equal to 8. These are based on crew limits. We are using the activities codes instead.  In summary:

FY2007-2014: No limit on crew (except for 7 in DMV starting in FY2014)
FY2015-2019: 8

> Initially, vessels had the same crew limits in access areas as they did on DAS.  However, Framework 18(fishing year 2006) eliminated the seven-person crew limit (five-person limit for small dredge category vessels) for scallop access area trips. The purpose of this was to eliminate inefficiencies caused by the crew limit for fishing activity that is limited by a possession limit. The crew limit was established to control vesselsâ€™ shucking capacity when fishing under DAS. 

> Eight years later, Framework 25 (fishing year 2014) imposed a crew limit of seven individuals (the same as DAS) per limited access vessel (five-person limit for small dredge category vessels) in DMV.  The purpose of this was to protect small scallops and discourage vessels from highgrading.

>Framework 26 (fishing year 2015) implemented crew limits for all access areas. In an effort to protect small scallops and discourage vessels from high-grading.  Framework 26 imposed a crew limit of eight individuals (one extra from DAS) per limited access vessel, including the captain, when fishing in any scallop access area. If a vessel is participating in the small dredge program, it may not have more than six people (one extra from DAS) on board, including the captain, on an access area trip. 

>Finally, because the scallops in the NLSâ€“Sâ€“D were expected to have lower yield than similar sized scallops in other areas, Framework 32 (fishing year 2020) allowed two additional crew members aboard both limited access full-time (10 in total) and limited access full-time small dredge vessels (8 in total). This allowed vessels to add additional crew members to increase the shucking capacity of the vessel and reach the possession limit in a time more consistent with other access areas.

#  A place to store your username and password.  
#  To use this:
#    make a copy of this file.
#    Name the copy "credentials.R"
#    Place it in your root directory.  
#    Fill in your oracle_username, oracle_password.  

#  Depending on how the rest of your system is configured, you may find it useful to fill in the rest of the connection details here (like the path to the server, port, ssid).

# "R_credentials.R" has been added to .gitignore, but verify that actually has happened before the first commit.
